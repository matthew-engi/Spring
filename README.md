Springs are a powerful tool for creating smooth and responsive animations.  
In many cases—such as simulating initial velocity or dynamic movement—`TweenService` falls short.  
For example, when animating a pet following the player, spring-based motion feels significantly more natural and lifelike compared to traditional tweens.

## ✋ Restrictions

Type `T` must support the following operations:

1. **Addition (`+`)**  
   → `add(T, T): T`

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**  
   → `sub(T, T): T`

3. **Multiplication (`×`)**  
   → `mul(T, number): T`

4. **Division (`÷`)**  
   → `div(T, number): T`

> *Note: This is achievable using metamethods `__add`, `__sub`, `__mul`, and `__div` for custom types.*

## 🔑 Recommendations

1. **Render loop handling is your responsibility:**
   - You may keep a spring connected at all times, but this may lead to heavier computation.
   - Consider creating a `SpringHandler` module to manage active spring connections.
   - Disconnect unused springs to reduce unnecessary performance costs.
